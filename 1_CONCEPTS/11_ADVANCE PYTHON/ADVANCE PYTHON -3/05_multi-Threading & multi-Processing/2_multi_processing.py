"""
Multiprocessing is a technique where multiple processes are created to execute tasks concurrently.
Each process has its own memory space, which avoids issues like GIL, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks.

ðŸ’¡Key Concepts:
-> Process: An independent execution unit that has its own memory space.

-> No GIL Limitation: Each process runs in its own Python interpreter, 
so the GIL does not limit the parallel execution of Python code.

-> Inter-Process Communication (IPC): Processes don't share memory space, 
so you need mechanisms like pipes, queues, or shared memory to share data.

ðŸª´ Use Cases: Best suited for CPU-bound tasks like mathematical computations, image processing, or data analysis.
