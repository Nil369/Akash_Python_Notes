# Set is a collection of well-defined, non-repetitive objects/elements. 

'''
PROPERTIES OF SETS: 

1. Sets are unordered => Element’s order doesn’t matter 
2. Sets are unindexed => Cannot access elements by index 
3. There is no way to change items in sets. 
4. Sets cannot contain duplicate values.

e = set() # Dont use s = {} as it will create an empty dictionary
s = {1, 5, 32, 54,5, 5, 5} 


print(s)
